"""
Minimal, distributed reproducible example for Hugging Face IterableDataset
state_dict loading issue.

This script demonstrates that `load_state_dict` does not correctly restore the
state of a sharded `IterableDataset` in a distributed setting.

To run:
    $ python repro_bug_minimal.py

Expected (Correct) Behavior:
Each rank should process its first 5 samples, save a checkpoint, and then
when resuming, it should start from the 6th sample in its partition.

Observed (Buggy) Behavior:
After loading the state, the dataset's internal state is unchanged. The resumed
iteration starts from the beginning of the partition, not from the checkpoint.


Here's the step-by-step explanation:
The Key Concepts
The whole situation boils down to two main points about IterableDataset:
Lazy State Loading: load_state_dict() doesn't immediately apply the state. It just "primes" the dataset object, staging the state to be used the next time you create an iterator from it.
Iterator-Owned State: The actual iteration progress is managed by the iterator object (the one you get from iter(dataset)), not the dataset object itself.
What's Happening in Your Script
Let's trace the execution and logs:
Initial Run & Checkpoint:
Your script starts, and each rank begins iterating through its unique shard of the data.
Rank 0 processes indices [0, 1, 2].
Rank 1 processes indices [10, 11, 12].
You then call iterable_ds_initial.state_dict() to save the state. This works as expected, capturing the progress after 3 steps.
The "Deceiving" Part (Loading the State):
You create a new dataset: iterable_ds_resumed = create_sharded_dataset().
You load the checkpoint: iterable_ds_resumed.load_state_dict(state_dict_midway).
You then immediately check the state: iterable_ds_resumed.state_dict().
Why it's deceiving: The log shows the initial state ('batch_idx': 0), not the state you just loaded. This is because load_state_dict only staged the state; it hasn't been applied yet because no iterator has been created.
The "Incorrect" State (Creating the Iterator):
You create a new iterator: iterator_resumed = iter(iterable_ds_resumed).
This is the magic step: Internally, the __iter__ method sees the staged state and creates an iterator that knows to start from step 3.
You then check the state again: iterable_ds_resumed.state_dict().
Why it seems incorrect: The log still shows the initial state. This is the most confusing part. It seems there's a design quirk in datasets where the dataset object itself doesn't update its state_dict() to reflect the state of the new iterator it just created. So, state_dict() reports stale information. This is why your check if state_dict_midway != state_after_iter: fails and you see the State was not restored correctly! error.
The Proof of Success (Resuming Iteration):
Despite the confusing logs about the state, you then loop over iterator_resumed.
Rank 0 processes [3, 4, 5].
Rank 1 processes [13, 14, 15].
This is the correct, resumed behavior! It picked up exactly where the checkpoint left off.
Your final assertion, assert indices_after_ckpt_no_load == indices_after_ckpt_with_load, passes, which is the ultimate proof that resumption worked perfectly.
Summary
Action	What IterableDataset Does	What You See in Logs
ds.load_state_dict(state)	"Primes" the dataset. It holds onto state but doesn't apply it yet.	ds.state_dict() still shows the old (initial) state.
iterator = iter(ds)	Creates a new iterator that correctly starts from the primed state.	ds.state_dict() still shows the old state, which is misleading. The state seems to be consumed by the iterator without updating the parent dataset object.
for sample in iterator:	The iterator yields the correct data, continuing from the checkpoint.	The data you process is correct, proving resumption worked.
In short: The data resumption is working correctly, but the state reporting via dataset.state_dict() after loading is misleading. You should trust the data you get from the iterator, not what state_dict() reports after you've loaded a checkpoint.

    The main test function executed by each process.

    Demonstrates the key behavior of `IterableDataset.load_state_dict` across
    multiple epochs:
    1.  **Epoch 1**:
        - Iterates partway through the dataset.
        - Saves a checkpoint (`state_dict`).
        - Finishes iterating through the rest of the epoch.
    2.  **Restore & Resume**:
        - Creates a new dataset instance.
        - Loads the checkpoint (`load_state_dict`).
        - Verifies that iteration resumes correctly from the checkpoint and
          runs until the end of the epoch.
    3.  **Epoch 2**:
        - Starts a new epoch on the *restored* dataset.
        - Verifies that it correctly iterates from the very beginning of the
          dataset, proving that exhaustion of a restored iterator correctly
          resets the state for the next epoch.

    The key takeaway is that `load_state_dict` "primes" the dataset for the
    *next* iterator created from it. The dataset's state is consumed by that
    iterator, and once exhausted, the dataset is ready for a fresh epoch.
